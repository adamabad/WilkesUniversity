Program to keep track of library books.
You will enter the name of a file.
The program will read this file as the list
of books already checked out. You will then enter
a lender code followed by a book description to
check out or return a book.
When the program is done, it will write out the
current list of checked out books to the original file
and print a list of the checked out books.
