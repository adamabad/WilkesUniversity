Purpose: Results of Project 4, Image Classification

First Run:  16-8-2
Results:
[59.  60.5 59.  54.  55.  58.  48.  61.  56.  65. ]
Accuracy = 57.55 +/- 4.395736570814952

Second Run: 24-24-8
Results:
[84.  75.5 52.  84.  81.  58.5 87.  80.  56.  82. ]
Accuracy = 74.0 +/- 12.523977004130915

Procedure:

  Given the working neural classifier, the paramaters for the layers where
changed to match the required set. Each layer works by training on the set
and evaluating the results using the hidden layers of nodes.

  Based on my results, 16-8-2 provided much lower yields than the 24-24-8
run. This is likely because the amount of nodes used was too small to handle
the images. The second trial yielded a much higher average as well as a
higher range of results. Some of the results in trial 2 were lower than all
the results from trial one indicating that this node arrangement has a higher
varriance depending on the training set. Regardless, the classifier was able
to identify on average, much more on the second set with a max of 87% correct.

  The node arrangement may be streamlined in future trials as having 24 for the
second layer may have been involved in the large variance in the results.
